## 2.4.1 Appointment Types and Durations

### Available Appointment Types
The system supports 8 distinct appointment types defined as enums:

1. **initial_consultation** - First-time client assessments
2. **follow_up** - Ongoing therapy sessions
3. **therapy_session** - Standard therapeutic appointments
4. **group_therapy** - Multi-client sessions
5. **assessment** - Clinical evaluations
6. **medication_management** - Psychiatric consultations
7. **crisis_intervention** - Emergency mental health appointments
8. **other** - Flexible appointment category

### Duration Configuration
- **Default Duration**: 60 minutes (configurable in SchedulingSettings)
- **Available Options**: 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 minutes
- **Buffer Time**: 0-30 minutes between appointments (configurable)
- **Time Slot Intervals**: 15, 30, or 60-minute increments

### Implementation Details
```typescript

-- recurring_series table:
pattern: recurrence_pattern enum
interval_value: integer
days_of_week: day_of_week array
start_date: date
end_date: date (optional)
max_occurrences: integer (optional)
```

### Recurrence Patterns Supported

## Security Considerations

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Appointments Table**: ‚ùå **CRITICAL SECURITY GAP** - No RLS policies implemented
- **Provider Schedules**: Limited RLS implementation
- **Waitlist**: Basic access controls

### HIPAA Compliance
‚úÖ **Implemented**:
- Client data protection in appointment displays
- Secure appointment conflict checking
- Audit logging framework exists

‚ùå **Gaps**:
- No appointment access logging
- Missing data retention policies for old appointments
- No encryption at rest verification

### Authentication Requirements
- All scheduling operations require authentication
- Provider-specific schedule access
- Client assignment verification

**Security Risk**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Appointments table lacks RLS policies

---

## Error Handling

### Form Validation
‚úÖ **Comprehensive validation** in appointment forms:
- Required field validation
- Date/time format validation
- Conflict prevention
- Business rule enforcement

### API Error Handling
```typescript
// Error handling patterns:
- useToast for user notifications
- Try-catch blocks in mutations
- Graceful degradation for network issues
- Loading states during operations
```

### User Feedback
- **Real-time validation**: Immediate field-level feedback
- **Conflict warnings**: Visual alerts for scheduling conflicts
- **Success notifications**: Confirmation of successful operations
- **Error recovery**: Clear error messages with suggested actions

### Current Gaps
‚ùå **Missing**:
- Offline appointment management
- Bulk operation error handling
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Error analytics and monitoring

---

## Logging and Auditing

### Current Logging
‚úÖ **Basic logging** exists for:
- Appointment creation/modification
- Conflict detection events
- User interaction tracking

### Audit Requirements
‚ùå **Missing critical audit features**:
- Appointment access logging (HIPAA requirement)
- Schedule change audit trail
- Waitlist operation tracking
- Reminder delivery logs

### Compliance Gaps
**HIPAA Requirements Not Met**:
- No comprehensive access logging for appointments
- Missing audit trail for schedule modifications
- No data retention policy implementation
- Insufficient security event logging

---

## Compliance Score: 68/100

### Breakdown:
- **Functionality**: 75/100 (Core features present, but missing key components)
- **Security**: 45/100 (Major RLS gaps, basic auth in place)
- **HIPAA Compliance**: 60/100 (Framework exists, missing audit requirements)
- **Error Handling**: 80/100 (Good user experience, some gaps)
- **Logging**: 40/100 (Basic logging, missing audit trail)

**Overall Assessment**: The Scheduling Module provides a solid foundation with excellent user experience and real-time capabilities. However, **critical security and compliance gaps** must be addressed immediately, particularly RLS implementation and HIPAA audit requirements. The missing recurring appointments feature significantly impacts clinical workflow efficiency.

**Recommendation**: **HIGH PRIORITY** security remediation required before production deployment.
